# Project 1: Data Analysis of Bank Client's Risk of Defaulting

## Introduction for the project

The goal for this project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. The bank needs to know if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

## Outline of Analysis

* Opened and assessed the characteristics of the data.
* Preprocessed the data: 
  - Dealt with missing values.
  - Examined features and handled strange values.
  - Filled NaN's with appropriate values.
  - Normalized and lemmatized each string for categorization.
  - Assigned classes within each feature using for-loops.
 * Created pivot tables aggregated on the "debt" feature to visualize relationship with other features.
